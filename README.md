# ESP01 Proximity Relay

Proximity sensor aided relay to my bathroom mirror lights.

Want a discrete light switch which can be operated by reaching out to your light source?
Forgot to switch off the bathroom mirror light, but too lazy to get up from the bed?
Here you go.

WIP:
- wiring diagram
- Enclosure STL model files

## What you need

- Arduino Studio
- ESP8266-01
- JoyIt ESP-01S relay module (or compatible)
- CH340 TTL-UART programmer (ideally with the flash button)
- soldering station
- some wires rated above your load
- (optional) Wago connectors nuts
- (optional) 3D printer

## Build

TODO

## Flash

You might run into connectivity issues with the most recent CH340 driver. Version ```08/08/2014, 3.4.2014.08``` worked for me without issues.
